My curriculum vitae - under constant construction.

Compiling Yourself
------------------

You shouldn't need to compile my CV yourself. Check out the `FRobinson-CV.pdf` file above for a precompiled version. 

The following notes are mostly for my own reference.

If you're having trouble compiling make sure you have all the necessary TeX packages installed. Under Arch:

    sudo pacman -S texlive-core texlive-latexextra

Or Debian:

    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended

Make sure to run bibtex too:

    bibtex FRobinson-CV
